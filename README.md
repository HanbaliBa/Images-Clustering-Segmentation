# Image Clustering and Segmentation

This project explores image clustering and segmentation techniques to categorize and segment images based on their visual features. Using unsupervised and supervised learning methods, the goal is to group similar images together and classify regions of interest within images for various applications such as image segmentation and feature extraction.

## Project Overview

In this project, several clustering algorithms are implemented and applied to a dataset of images. Additionally, supervised classification techniques are used for image segmentation, where each pixel of an image is classified into predefined categories. The primary focus is on feature extraction, clustering techniques, and supervised classification for segmentation tasks.

## Key Features

- **Feature Extraction**: The project extracts visual features such as color, texture, and shape from images.
- **Clustering Algorithms**: Various clustering algorithms, including K-means, K-medoids, Hierarchical, and Fuzzy C-Means, are implemented to group images based on extracted features.
- **Image Segmentation by Supervised Classification**: Supervised learning methods, such as decision trees or SVMs, are used for segmenting images by classifying pixels into distinct categories.
- **Applications**: The project demonstrates how clustering and segmentation can be used for tasks like image categorization, feature extraction, and pixel-level classification.
